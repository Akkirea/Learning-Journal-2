            <h1 class="intro">Hi there! My name is Erikka and welcome to my learning journal.</h1>
            <p class="intro-text">After several months into the Frontend Developer Career Path, I've made the big jump over to the Bootcamp to get expert code reviews of my solo projects and meet like-minded peers.</p>

        <h3>How I stay committed to learning</h3>
        <p class="text">I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend hours and hours learning, then try to create simple projects using what I learned or work new techniques into existing projects.
        <p class="text">While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I was learning and most things about my journey with the world.</p>
            
        <h3>How I got started</h3>
        <p class="text"> I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would take notes about what I was learning. After each learning session, I'd use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned but also write short summaries of what I learned using my own words.
        <p class="text">That helped me grasp what I was learning, and I realized that posting my learning summaries was also helping others learn and stay motivated.</p>
